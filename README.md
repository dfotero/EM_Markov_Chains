# EM_Markov_Chains
EM algorithm that transforms sparse data to Markov chains. 
We develop this algorithm based on the the algorithm presented in Sherlaw-johnson  AC,  et al. (1995)  Estimating  a  Markov  Transition  Matrix  from  Observational  Data.

You can check out the algorithm, our analysis, and application [here](https://rdcu.be/cYmag).
