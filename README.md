# EM_Markov_Chains
EM algorithm that transforms sparse data to Markov chains. 
We develop this algorithm based on the the algorithm presented in Sherlaw-johnson  AC,  Gallivan  S,  Burridge  J (1995)  Estimating  a  Markov  Transition  Matrix  from  Observational  Data.  Palgrave  Macmillan  Journals  on  behalf  of  the  Operational  Research  Society  Stable.
